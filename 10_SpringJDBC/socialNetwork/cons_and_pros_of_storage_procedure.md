There are several benefits and disadvantages of storage procedures in databases:

Benefits:

1. Reusability: Storage procedures can be used multiple times, reducing the need for writing the same code over and over again.
2. Stored procedures can be used to enforce security to prevent unauthorized access to data.
3. Reducing the potential for code duplication .

Disadvantages:

1. Difficult to debug: Stored procedures can be difficult to debug, especially if they contain complex logic.
2. Lack of transparency: Stored procedures can be opaque, making it difficult for developers to understand how they work and how to modify them.
3. Dependency on the database: Stored procedures are closely tied to the database and can be difficult to transfer to a different database management system.
4. Complexity: Stored procedures can become complex and difficult to maintain, especially if they contain complex business logic.
